# Wall-Follower-in-Webots
This project involves developing a **maze solving** logic that uses **wall following** algorithm to navigate and solve the maze.
<br>The robot is simulated using the **e-puck robot** and **Proximity sensors** in the **Webots simulating world.**

# Technologies Used
**Technologies**: Webots, e-puck robot, Proximity Sensors<br>**Skills**: Python, Robotics Simulation

# Algorithm Details
**1. Sensor Readings :** The Proximity sensors continuously monitor the distance from the walls.
<br>**2. Decision Making :** Based on the sensor readings, the robot decides whether to take a turn or keep moving forward.
<br>**3. Navigation :** The robot adjusts its speed and direction to follow the wall and navigate through the maze.

# Acknowledgements
<br>**1.** The **Webots simulation software** for providing a robust platform for robot simulation.
<br>**2.** The **e-puck robot community** for their support and resourses.
